		<br> Koenigsegg is an amazing Swedish company with alot of respect. Christian von Koenigsegg is the mastermind behind the company. He founded it in 1994, only 22 years old.<br><br> They have chrushed records before, but this is different. Their new car has a top speed of 447.19 km/h (277.87 mph). ThatÂ´s the highest top speed for a production vehicle ever. <br> <br>Koenigsegg is also known for their 0-300-0 tests. Since this car is a revolution, they decided to do a 0-400-0 test instead. The whole test was done in just 33.29 seconds! Beating the predecessor <br><br>with over 3 seconds. 3 seconds might not seem alot, but if you compare cars head to head, it is not far from a year.
